# meachine-learning-project-hand-written-analyzer
# we grab the data from the resouces 
#  we have to create the data frame to insert the flatterd pixels of pictures 
# by using matplotlib  read the images and we take only one dimentions of the image
#  by using numpy we flatterd the image and insert the data into dataframe 
after this all we split the data intro train and test 
we train the data by using meachine learning algorithem
finally we can pridict the data 
afetr that we can check by evalution metrics due this is an classification problem
